# Text-to-CAD Strategy: First Pass
## Engineering Files to IFC Generation for Civil Infrastructure

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This strategy outlines a comprehensive approach to develop an AI system that converts engineering design files and natural language prompts into Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) files for civil infrastructure projects. The focus is on hydraulic structures, foundation systems, and structural analysis data.

### PHASE 1: FOUNDATION STRATEGY

#### 1.1 Domain Specialization
**Target Domain**: Civil Infrastructure Engineering
- Hydraulic structures (floodwalls, culverts, weirs)
- Foundation systems (micropiles, footings, retaining walls)
- Structural analysis integration
- Geotechnical considerations

**Strategic Advantage**: 
- Predictable engineering patterns and standards
- Well-defined code requirements
- Structured data relationships
- Limited but deep domain scope

#### 1.2 File Type Analysis (Current Assets)
**Priority 1 - Structured Data**:
- Excel files: Floodwall Bearing, Micropile Capacity
- Direct property extraction → IFC PropertySets
- Quantitative engineering values (loads, capacities, dimensions)

**Priority 2 - Analysis Results**:
- .gsz files: GeoStudio geotechnical analysis
- .gp12* files: Structural analysis results
- .sczp/.scyp files: Analysis geometry/properties

**Priority 3 - Documentation**:
- PDF: Structural calculations
- OCR + NLP for material properties and design parameters
